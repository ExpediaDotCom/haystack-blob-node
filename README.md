# Haystack Blobs Library 

node module that dispatches req/resp blobs to haystack-agent and add corresponding span tag

## How to use the library?

Check our detailed [example](examples/index.js) on how to initialize opentracing haystack tracer, blob client, start a span, write request/response blobs and send it to one of the dispatchers.


## How to build this library?

`make build`

This library has been written in typescript, so we first compile them into js files under dist/ folder

```bash
make build
mkdir -p logs && node dist/examples/index.js
